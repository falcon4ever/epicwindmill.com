Weâ€™ve updated Super Hexagon for Android today. Due to the improved timing code, the game should run smoother and feel more responsive on many devices, especially the ones running Ice Cream Sandwich.

Changes:

- New improved timing code, which reduces input lag on several devices (including the Nexus 7).
- Removed the legacy options button.
- Improved game setup, game should launch faster.
- General bugfixes.
