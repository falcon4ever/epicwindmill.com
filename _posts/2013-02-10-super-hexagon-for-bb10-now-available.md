### Press release

> *“Surprise! Super Hexagon is now available for the new Blackberry 10! This wasn’t originally something I had lined up – the opportunity to do it just sorta came along.*
> 
> *Basically, [Laurence Muller](https://epicwindmill.com/), who ported the C++ openFrameworks version of the game to Android, has an interest in Blackberry – he maintains [the unofficial Blackberry port of openFrameworks](http://www.multigesture.net/2012/04/27/playbook-add-on-ofxqnx/). So when Blackberry came along and asked us to do the port, we figured, let’s give it a shot!*
> 
> *If you’ve got one of these fancy new Blackberry 10 devices, you can get it from [here](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/22507872/), or the store on your device. (A playbook version is also a possibility at a later date.) Enjoy!*“
