Epic Windmill is proud to present another audio application for the Android platform. In collaboration with [Dan Comerchero](https://twitter.com/quiztones), we’ve been working hard to bring the popular iOS/Mac frequency ear training app [Quiztones](http://quiztones.net/) to the Android platform. It is now available at [Google Play](http://quiztones.net/android).

### Press release

> *“MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., September 6, 2012 – Quiztones founder Dan Comerchero announces the release of an Android version of the popular ear training app Quiztones.*
> 
> *Quiztones for Android is a frequency ear training app for amateur and professional audio engineers, producers, and musicians. Previously only available for Mac and iOS, it has helped countless musicians and audio professionals train their ears to instantly and intuitively recognize frequencies. This is useful when mixing, adjusting EQ settings, and identifying/eliminating feedback.*
> 
> *Audio professionals as well as amateur musicians spend a great deal of time analyzing frequencies, whether adjusting them for a good mix in the studio, or trying to get rid of feedback on stage. Ear training with Quiztones can make this a lot faster and easier by training the ear and eliminating trial and error methods of frequency identification such as sweeping.*“
