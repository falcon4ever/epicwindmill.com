It’s official now, I’m proud owner of my new startup company Epic Windmill.

Previously known for my research work in the field of [multitouch, HCI and information visualization](http://www.multigesture.net/), Epic Windmill will be serving as a place for my creative and casual software projects. For the time being, it will focus on the development of applications for handheld devices such as smartphones and tablets (Android and iOS).

Currently two apps are already available from the Android Market, [NodeBeat](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.AffinityBlue.NodeBeat) (a creative audio sequencer) and [fIRC](https://epicwindmill.com/firc/) (a free chat app). We’re preparing a release for NodeBeat so be sure to follow [@NodeBeat](https://twitter.com/#!/nodebeat) for more details. A new fIRC will be released later this month.
