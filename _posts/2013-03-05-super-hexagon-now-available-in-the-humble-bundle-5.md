### Press release

> We’re back with number five of our Android (also for Windows, Mac, and Linux) game bundles: Humble Bundle with Android 5! And we’ve got a load of fantastic games and soundtracks to keep you entertained!
>

>
> Name your price for six awesome games available on Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux: **Beat Hazard Ultra**, **Dynamite Jack**, **Solar 2**, and **NightSky HD**. And if you pay more than the average, you’ll also get **Super Hexagon** and **Dungeon Defenders**!
> 
> Like previous bundles, if you pay more than $1, you’ll also get keys to optionally redeem on Steam.
> 
> There’s more though! You can also choose how you want to distribute your money – to the developers or to the two non-profit charities, Child’s Play Charity and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. And if you love this bundle, a tip to Humble Bundle would be greatly appreciated!
