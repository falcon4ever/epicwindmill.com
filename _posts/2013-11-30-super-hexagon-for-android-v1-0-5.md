We just pushed out a new update of Super Hexagon to Google Play. This version should improve the overall user experience of the app and fix some minor issues.

With this new release, we also took the opportunity to replace the scoring and achievement system. Instead of [Scoreloop](http://www.scoreloop.com/), the game now uses [Google Play Game Services](https://developers.google.com/games/services/) which should integrate better with the Android platform and provide a nicer way of sharing scores to social media platforms. (You can also install [Google Play Games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.play.games) for more options)
