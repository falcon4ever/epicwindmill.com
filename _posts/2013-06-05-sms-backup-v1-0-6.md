A minor update of [SMS Backup](https://epicwindmill.com/sms-backup/)

### Changelog for v1.0.6

> **Changes:**
> 
> - This new version is build using Native SDK 10.0.9.2743
> - It now supports all devices BB10 devices (Z10 / Q10 / Q5).  
>     (The app now supports Verizon devices that are still using 10.0.9)

> **Added:**
> 
> - Added support for (future) Q5 owners
> - The only new (experimental) feature is that it now also exports all attachments from any MMS entries in the database. There is no option to import them back yet though (so if you use MMS, keep a backup for a future release that does supports importing them back).
