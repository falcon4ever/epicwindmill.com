We’ve released a new version of [SMS Backup](https://epicwindmill.com/sms-backup/) that should take care of some minor issues in the UI and UX.

### Changelog for v1.0.4

> **Added:**
> 
> - <span style="line-height: 13px;">Feedback on missing permissions</span>
> - Keep the screen awake (during import and export to prevent the app from pausing)
> - Clean up phone numbers on import by removes dashes and spaces (e.g. “xxx yyy zzzz” and “xxx-yyy-zzzz” willl become xxxyyyzzzz). This should result in less broken conversations.
> 
> **Fixed:**
> 
> - Missing sender’s name in the received message (in conversation view)
> - Use the correct latest timestamp in message list
> - Use the address field (phone number) on unknown entries instead of listing (Unkown).
> - Typos in UI
> 
> After upgrading SMS Backup please complete the following steps to fix the missing sender’s name and conversation timestamps:
> 
> 1. Create a complete backup of your text messages
> 2. Erase all text messages
> 3. Import the backup you made in step 1
