Since weâ€™re getting a lot of questions on how to view or print backup files, we have made a short tutorial video on this.

Before opening the backup file (\*.xml), make sure that a stylesheet file (sms.xsl) is present in the same folder. If you are copying the file to the computer, both files need to be transferred.

To edit the backup file you should use an advanced editor such as [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) that knows how to deal with XML files. If you just want to view the content or print conversations, you can do so by opening the backup file with Internet Explorer or Firefox.
