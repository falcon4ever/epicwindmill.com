Epic Windmill is proud to present Super Hexagon for Android, the award winning minimal action game by [Terry Cavanagh](http://distractionware.com/blog/about-me/), with music by [Chipzel](http://chipzelmusic.bandcamp.com/).

### Press release

> *“Super Hexagon is now available for Android! To celebrate, it’s having an 99c [android launch sale](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.distractionware.superhexagon)!*
> 
> *Hats off to [Laurence Muller](https://epicwindmill.com/), who coded the port, and made this possible. We’ve done lots and lots of testing and fixing to make this work well on as many android devices as possible, but of course, on as wide a platform as android, bugs are inevitable. If you encounter any problems, [our android support page is here](http://superhexagon.com/android/).”*
